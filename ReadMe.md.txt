U          Increase Rotation Rate in X axis 
+ Control  Increase the Scale in X axis 
+ Shift    Positive Translation in the X Axis 

J          Decrease Rotation Rate in X axis 
+ Control  Decrease the Scale in X axis 
+ Shift    Negative Translation in the X Axis

I          Increase Rotation Rate in Y axis 
+ Control  Increase the Scale in Y axis Positive 
+ Shift    Translation in the Y Axis 

K          Decrease Rotation Rate in Y axis 
+ Control  Decrease the Scale in Y axis 
+ Shift    Negative Translation in the Y Axis 

O          Increase Rotation Rate in Z axis 
+ Control  Increase the Scale in Z axis 
+ Shift    Positive Translation in the Z Axis 

L          Decrease Rotation Rate in Z axis 
+ Control  Decrease the Scale in Z axis 
+ Shift    Negative Translation in the Z Axis

I render the heightmap as the bottom of the box which will make the program looks more activating.
